# BookShare

A fullstack web application for sharing and discovering books. Built with **Next.js** on the frontend and **Node.js + Express** on the backend.
# Backend

 **Node.js + Express** backend designed to power a book exchange platform. It supports user authentication, personal bookshelves, market listings, and private messaging between users. The backend uses **MongoDB via Mongoose** for data persistence and follows a modular, controller-based architecture with clean separation of concerns.
### Authentication

Authentication is handled using **JSON Web Tokens**. Protected routes use a custom middleware that verifies tokens, extracts user identity, and injects it into the request object for downstream access. Both internal - mongo and external - google identifiers are supported.

### Architecture

- **Controllers**: All business logic is encapsulated in controller files. Each controller handles request validation, database interaction, and response formatting.

- **Routes**: Express routers delegate incoming requests to the appropriate controller functions. Middleware is applied per route to enforce authentication and access control.

- **Models & Schemas**: Mongoose models define the structure of documents. Schemas include validation rules to ensure data integrity.

- **Middleware**: Custom middleware handles authentication and request shaping. 

### Real-Time Chat with WebSockets

In addition to RESTful messaging endpoints, this backend supports **real-time private messaging** using **WebSockets** (via socket.io). This enables instant communication between users without needing to poll the server. Messages sent through WebSocket are emitted to the recipientâ€™s room in real time and persisted for history retrieval.
